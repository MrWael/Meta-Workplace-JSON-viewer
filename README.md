#     Meta-Workplace-JSON-viewer
If you've downloaded your Meta Workplace data in JSON format, this tool lets you read the chats.
Useful if you've deleted Workplace, but downloaded your JSON data.

As raw JSON, it's hard to read and it's in reverse chronological order:

Using this Meta Workplace JSON viewer, it looks much better:

## How to use

Here's a quick demo:

### Step 1.
#### Method 1
I have this tool [hosted on my website](https://simonwong.io/fb_chat_viewer/). You can select your JSON files and all the data will be processed client-side so you don't have to worry about me reading your chats üòÅ

#### Method 2
Clone this repo and run `chat_display.html` on your browser.

### Step 2.
Once you've opened the link or cloned the repo and opened the HTML file, you will need to choose your JSON file that you want to parse using the file selector.

After selecting your file. This will put the messages on the left, in bubbles.

Voil√†, your chats can now be easily read.
